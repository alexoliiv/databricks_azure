## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a  data engineering pipeline using Azure Databricks to process and manage a comprehensive database of Formula 1 championship. The goal is to create an efficient, scalable, and reliable data infrastructure that can handle large volumes of data, ensuring data quality and availability for analytical and machine learning tasks.

## Objectives
- Data Ingestion: Streamline the process of importing diverse Formula 1 datasets into the data lake.
- Data Transformation: Clean, preprocess, and transform raw data into a structured and analysis-ready format.
- Data Storage: Implement efficient storage solutions for both raw and processed data.
- Data Orchestration: Automate the data pipeline to ensure continuous and timely data processing.
- Data Quality Assurance: Establish data quality checks and monitoring to maintain high data integrity.
- Documentation and Reporting: Document the data pipeline and generate reports on data processing and quality metrics.
